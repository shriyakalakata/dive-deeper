## Design

[Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/MtmBlXWq7G9Axki5tmboSd/Project-2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=mF8G6yOHcrtvsROr-1)

## Set Up

1. Download the source code from the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/software-students-spring2024/2-web-app-exercise-gas2.git
    ```

2. Install pipenv using pip or pip3
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    ```
    or 
    ```
    pip3 install pipenv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
    ```
    pipenv shell
    ```

4. Install the dependencies
    ```
    pipenv install
    ```

5. Create a file called `.env`. Populate it with the following:
    ```
    MONGO_DBNAME=gas
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@gas.xhjamgl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=gas
    SECRET_KEY=<key>
    ```
    To run it locally using Dive Deeper's database via MongoDB Atlas, you need to replace  `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<key>` with the right information. Please contact the authors for this information.

    Note: using your own database

    Alternatively, you can create your own database. Replace the `MONGO_URI` string with the connection string generated by MongoDB. Replace `MONGO_DBNAME` with the name of your database, and replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the credentials used to generate the database. Also replace `<key>` with a secret key of your choosing. Furthermore, make sure to create a collection named `users` and another collection named `decks`.

6. Finally run the app
    ```
    flask run
    ```
